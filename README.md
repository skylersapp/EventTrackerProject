## Overview
### [Part One](https://github.com/SkillDistillery/SD24/blob/master/rest/EventTracker/README.md)

	  'Event Tracker' is a broad term for anything that keeps track of information over time. Examples of these applications are 'Mint' (financial tracking) and 'MyFitnessPal' (diet and exercise tracker). These are very involved applications with a huge feature set.

	  You are embarking on a weekend project that you may or may not come back to afterwards, thus we would caution you to limit your scope significantly. Examples of limited scope would be 'Gas Tracker' (keep track of your fill ups and total mileage to determine dollar/gallon in your car) or 'Timesheet' (track time in and time out to calculate total hours at some rate of pay).

### [Part Two](https://github.com/SkillDistillery/SD24/blob/master/javascript/eventTracker/README.md)

	This project is as much about using JSON and SpringREST as it is handling JSON responses with JavaScript.

	You are embarking on a weekend project that you may or may not come back to afterwards, thus we would caution you to limit your scope significantly. Last weekend we created a RESTful API that provided us with the ability to perform full CRUD on an event entity of our choosing.

	This weekend we will be building out the front end for this application using Javascript.

### [Part Three](https://github.com/SkillDistillery/SD24/blob/master/angular/eventTracker/README.md)

	 'Event Tracker' is a broad term for anything that keeps track of information over time. Examples of these applications are 'Mint' (financial tracking) and 'MyFitnessPal' (diet and exercise tracker). These are very involved applications with a huge feature set. You are embarking on a weekend project that you may or may not come back to afterwards, thus we would caution you to limit your scope significantly. Examples of limited scope would be 'Gas Tracker' (keep track of your fill ups and total mileage to determine dollar/gallon in your car) or 'Timesheet' (track time in and time out to calculate total hours at some rate of pay).

	Last weekend we wrote the backend for our API that performed full CRUD on an event object. We are going to pick up where we left off and build a front end to manipulate and display this data to the client.
